- Likner: Linker script must be built hiearchically. This is required since Umbra, as a library, will be placed in a fixed memory region depending on the target platform.
  The platform linker script will define the secure boot region and the umbra kernel region. The kernel linker script will be used by the host as well as we must
  ensure umbra to share the same position for both the host and the secure boot. The idea is to have two separate elf, both including umbra sections. If they are
  overlapped, it is possible to load both elf in memory and having a consistent behaviour (allowing for the host to be independent from the boot code).
  Note that drivers are included in the secure boot elf, and not in the umbra kernel.

- TOML: The config.toml should be a common file among different projects. Similarly to the linker script, a hierarchy of config.toml should exists (if doable).
  There are multiple ways to do so, but a choice could be to have a top-level config.toml that includes a config.toml for the architecture and for the platform.
  (including flags and compilers). architecture and platform can be passed to the settings.sh script. In addition to this, redefine CARGO envvar with settings.sh
   
- Currently, there is a Makefile in the boot project. It can be fine, but we need a top-level Makefile that, depending on the settings.sh configuration,
  will build (a) the Kernel library and (b) the boot binary for the specific combination {architecture, platform}.

- Compiler: Problems with linking the liberknel.a. First, the library is quite bloated (5MB in .a and 41KB in .rlib). 
  I am not entirely sure why this happens; must investigate further. A key observation is that rustc backend is llvm, and can use
  3 profiles for armv8:
    - target.thumbv8m.base-none-eabi
    - target.thumbv8m.main-none-eabi
    - target.thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
  when compiling the host code, be sure to use the correct -march flag (e.g. -march=armv8-m.main).

- Updating ENVVAR:
    -- Compiler target
    -- Selected Platform (therefore, linkerscript structure)
